Assumptions --

1. Loss for Clinics will increase every year - which makes them not sustainable
2. Mobile Services - may increase costs (introducing a new model - needs analysis. Since we are not shutting down Offsites - these are additional costs)
3. Increasing community outreach is not primary respons-- of hospital
4. Cutting down staff, temporary solution but impacts quality of service to the primary consumers(which may impact brand image and revenue. This creates a snowball effect)


Recommendations --

1. Cannot risk cutting staff/quality of treatment and brand reputation
2. Instead of maintaining all Offsite clinics - Shut down strategically and optimise scheduling.
3. While clinics are trimmed - lobby with govt for more funds and community outreach
4. Operate clinics twice a week etc instead of daily



Key Facts

1. Most consumers are substance abusers - not emergency response - so do not need daily services. Can schedule in advance.
2. Pre-Natal patients - declining. And data suggests that clinic has not made a difference to the birth-weight ratio anyways - not primary focus.
3. Declining Brand Image already. 
4. City will cut down funds - increase losses in coming years.
